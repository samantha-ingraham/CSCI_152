java notes 8/26/24

file creation needs .java
depending on editor may come with boilerplate
boilerplate= shit you always need to make the file work. nothing can be done without them
second part of boiler plate, creating main method. not just main like in python.
"public static void main(String[] args){}"-- every java program requires
public=access modifier, program compiler cant read it without.
static is a non access modifier. 
void- return type that return nothing/void
main- method name, entry point for program
string[]- expected argument for main method
args- name of the argument, everything needs an argument type, no inference in java
comments
// single line
/* multiline
 * happens
 * like this
 * star slash terminates
 */

 java- a lot more complex to get some of the same results as python
 however, you can change the fundamental fabric of the program in your boiler plate, and java offers way more customization
