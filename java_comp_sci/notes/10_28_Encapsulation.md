Access Modifiers
        -tend to be public for testclasses(object)
        -there are four access modifiers
                -public:code is accessible across all packages,libraries,classes,etc.
                -private:only accessible within the declared class. sort of like "static" methods.
                -default:used when you dont use any specific modifier. very similar to public, but cannot be used across packages ?can it be used in libraries?
                -protected: family tree private. can be used in it's own class, or subclasses.but not everywhere

Scope
        -important when discussing access. 
        -access can affect scope?
        -public attributes can be used outside of their OG home, private is restricted to it's local scope/class global scope.
