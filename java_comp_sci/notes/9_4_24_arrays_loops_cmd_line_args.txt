Arrays:
****can be made two ways: indirect and direct (see slide 1)
int arr[]={
    1,
    2,
    3,
        };   ***makes an array with stored info already of length 3
****or
int arrTwo[] = new int[3]; ***makes an array of length 3

****to add data

arrTwo[0]=1;
arrTwo[1]=2;
arrTwo[2]=3;

**** can hold any primitive data type and in many cases non-prim data

Conditionals: if/else, else if
if (x>2 true/false){
    your code here
} else if(x<2 true/false){
    your code here
} else{
    your final code here
}
*** if (false): shouldnt ever run

Loops:
while loops: simplest form of loop.
*** has a boolean condition its checking, once it goes through it's code block it goes back to the while a checks again.
***

For loop: more refined, count based loop. 
for(int = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    code shit
}
*** likely will use this more than while loop since we can condense our loops more. i-- and i++ to increment either direction

for each loop: also called enhanced for loop, more similar to python 
for(int i:array){
    do stuff
}

== (in python)
for i in array: 
    do stuff
**** most languages that use a for each element structure call it something similar to a for each, good for more simple coverage
**** handles scaling well (what is meant by scaling???)
**** for each loops dont let you edit array size- will give you an error

CMD line:
**** for development the command line is essential
**** there are often gui workarounds for any given tool, but by using these cheats all the time you run the risk of
    >you may never learn cmd line, and will miss out on on better tools right after their conception
    > sacrifice speed and efficiency
    >will be required in this class
    > $cd<some directory>
    > look up some basics and write them down
    > pwd =print working directory
    > ls = shows you everything in your current location (-a shows hidden files)
    > rm some file 
    >rm -rf =very dangerous command  never ever ever ever use rm-rf/* because it literally nukes every single thing on your computer
    >ask patriarchy man how to add that block so my dumbass doesn't accidentally delete everything

CMD line arguments: part of boiler plate (String[] args)
string args= command line args
