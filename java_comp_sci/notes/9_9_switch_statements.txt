switch statements

SWITCH STATEMENTS help avoid huge if else statements- just for us, compiler treats it the same as a huge if else statement so doesnt save run time

"switch(expression-not boolean) {
    case x:
        //code block
        break;
    case y:
        //code block
        break;
    default:
        // code block"
}

***putting most likely cases near top will actually save run time
**break statements aren't required, but the rest of the cases will also be checked if you don't have a break statement
**if you want something to run at the end every time, don't use break statements
***helpful for user input

****most helpful bit is it lets you know when there are duplicate cases.

conditional operators: some people like, some people dislike- only works on boolean. ternary operator(atcs of 3 operands)

example:

(some expression) ? "what i want if expression=true" : "what i want if expression=false"

Boolean darkmode = false

String textcolor = (darkmode) ? "white" : "black"


****structure={}
if a structure only has one line of code you can omit curly braces.
eg
if(true) System.out.println();

if(true)
    system.out.println();

if(true) {system.out.println()};
